    	<h1 id="par-1">Overview</h1>
    	<h1 id="par-2">PCI Requirements</h1>
    	The following are extracts from the PCI Frequently Asked Questions.
    	<p>
    	<b>Question to PCI: What vulnerabilities must be taken into account for a touch screen? </b>
    	</p>
    	<p>
		<b>PCI Answer:</b><i> The API for firmware and applications (if applicable) needs to be
		looked at carefully to determine the conditions under which plain-text data entry is
		allowed. Example: it should not be possible unless under acquirer display prompt
		controlled devices, for a third party to display an image (JPEG) that states
		"press enter when ready for PIN entry" and then have a plain-text ke pop up on the
		next screen. The extra caution is warranted for touch screen devices because of the desire
		to make touch-screen devices user-friendly and to run many different, unauthenticated,
		uncontrolled applications. This is especially true for the devices that are intended to
		be held because of the tendency to regard them as a PDA that can perform debit transactions.</i></p>
		<p>
		<b>Equinox Comment:</b> Any screen that contains a keypad must also contain a clear
		and concise text message describing what is being prompted for.  If the screen is not
		clear and concise, it must not be signed.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;<p>
		<p>
		<b>Question to PCI: What restrictions exist if a device can display uncontrolled
		 messages and the keypad is used to enter non-PIN data? </b>
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>PCI Answer:</b><i> The prompts for non-PIN data entry must be under the control of
		the cryptographic unit and must be specific such that a cardholder would not enter
		a PIN at an inappropriate time. An uncontrolled message followed by an ambiguous
		prompt for non-PIN data could lead to a cardholder entering their PIN at an
		inappropriate time. For example, if the device displayed the uncontrolled message
		"Ready for PIN" then prompted for plain-text data while displaying "Enter 
		Data," the cardholder may enter their PIN at this non-PIN data prompt.</i></p>
		<p>
		<b>Equinox Comment:</b> The area of the screen that contains the signed prompt
		and potentially a touch screen numeric keypad cannot contain an uncontrolled message.
		However, the area outside the secure image may contain uncontrolled messages.
		For example, a screen may contain the uncontrolled message "Total amount due $15.69"
		and the secure area may contain a signed image prompting "Enter TIP Amount"
		and a numeric touch screen keypad. </p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;<p>
		
		<b>Question to PCI:</b> Is it acceptable for uncontrolled messages to be displayed
		 simultaneously with prompts for data entry? 
		<p>
		<b>PCI Answer:</b><i> No. Any text, including images, other than numbers and
		 punctuation, displayed along with a prompt is considered a prompt and must
		 comply with all requirements governing prompts. </i></p>
		<p>
		<b>Equinox Comment:</b> The Luxe secure prompt image file does not allow for
		 uncontrolled messages to be shown within the prompt.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;<p>
		<p>&nbsp;<p>
		
		<h1 id="par-3">Signing the Secure Image File</h1>
		The SDK terminal contains a ResourceSigner tool.  This allow the developer to
		 select an image, enter a Message Authentication (MAC) key, and ask the Luxe
		 to generate the corresponsing message signature.
		For development terminals, it is assumed that the terminal will have test
		 keys injected and the developer must use the same (test) key when signing
		 the secure image resource.
		<p>
		For productions terminals, as the production keys are secret, the secure
		 image files must be reviewed and signed using a secure signer system
		 that contains the production MAC key.
		<p>&nbsp;<p>
		<p>&nbsp;<p>
		<h1 id="par-4">Loading the Secure Resources</h1>
		<h2 id="sub-par-4-1">Loading Resources at Boot Time</h2>
		In <em>production</em> terminals, the secure resources are copied to the secure processor during
		 the terminal boot up process.  The secure processor will validate the resources 
		signature, and if authenticated, will store the resource into the internal secure area.
		<p>
		Global, system wide resources that are available to all programs are located in
		 directory /home/secure.  This directory contains a configuration file app.conf
		 that specifies the location of a resource control file.  For example:
		<pre>/home/secure/app.conf</pre>
		<table> <tr> <td class='codeBlock'>
<xmp><?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<application>
  <caption>Placeholder for Global Secure Resources</caption>
  <autolaunch>false</autolaunch>
  <browser launch="false" />
  <resources>resources/resources.xml</resources>
</application>
</xmp></td> </tr> </table>
		This specifies that there are global system wide resources and they are defined in the
		 following file:
		
		<table> <tr> <td class='codeBlock'><xmp>
<resources>
    <resource path="checkbox2.bmp" type="Background" keyId="10" name="checkbox2"/>
    <resource path="demo1.bmp"     type="Background" keyId="10" name="background"/>
    <resource path="EnterPIN.bmp"  type="PINMessage" keyId="10" id="150"/>
    <resource path="keyboard0.bmp" signature="3e0419452a89d837" type="Background" keyId="10" name="keyboard0">
    <resource path="keyboard1.bmp" type="Background" keyId="10" name="keyboard1"/>
    <resource path="keyboard2.bmp" type="Background" keyId="10" name="keyboard2"/>
    <resource path="menu-btn.bmp"  type="Background" keyId="10" name="menu-btn"/>
    <resource path="radiobox2.bmp" type="Background" keyId="10" name="radiobox2"/>
    <resource path="sign.bmp"      type="Background" keyId="10" name="sign"/>
    <resource path="keyboard0.res" type="Keyboard"   keyId="10" name="keyboard0"/>
    <resource path="keyboard1.res" type="Keyboard"   keyId="10" name="keyboard1"/>
    <resource path="keyboard2.res" type="Keyboard"   keyId="10" name="keyboard2"/>
</resources>
		</xmp></td> </tr> </table>
		The signature for each image resource file may either be specified in the resource
		 XML control file, or there must be a small signature file that contains the binary
		 value of the signature.  For example, the image file
		 <span style='font-family: "Courier New";'>keyboard0.bmp</span> has the signature
		 specified in the control file, whereas the signature for the image file
		<span style='font-family: "Courier New";'>keyboard1.bmp</span> is not in the control
		 file and is expected to be in a file <span style='font-family: "Courier New";'>keyboard0.bmp.sig</span>
		
		<h2 id="sub-par-4-2">Loading Resources at Run Time - SDK Terminal Only</h2>
		To allow the developer to rapidly generate and test secure images, the SDK adds three
		 secure resource HTTP API fucntions:
		<ul>
			<li>sdk/resource/load</li>
			<li>sdk/resource/unload</li>
			<li>sdk/resource/list</li>
		</ul>
