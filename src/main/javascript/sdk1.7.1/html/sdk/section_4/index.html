  <h1 id="par-1">Overview</h1>
	This document is the Application Programmer's Guide for the Equinox Payments Luxe family of terminals.
	<p>
	System Overview
	Applications for the Microsoft Luxe family of terminals can be written in:
	<ul>
	  <li/>HTML5 or JavaScript for a rich user experience environment
	  <li/>C or C++ for traditional code development
	  <li/>A combination of both coding styles
	</ul>
	The Luxe family uses a standard web browser to control the rendering of information that is displayed on the terminal.
	<br/>
	Web pages are assumed to consist of HTML objects, with CSS and JavaScript to control the formatting of its objects.
	  For C/C++ code to interact with the web based GUI, Equinox supplies a rich set of API functions as defined in the document
	<a href='/html/sdk/documentation/Luxe_HTTP_API_Specification.pdf'>Luxe HTTP API Specification</a>
	<p/>
	To assist in the generation of HTML pages, Microsoft has developed a drag-and-drop PageBuilder tool that creates HTML page templates which may be used as the basis for the end user’s HTML5 pages.

	<h1 id="par-2"><a href='/html/sdk/section_4/chapter_3.html'>Chapter 3 - Creating and Loading Secure Prompt Resources</a></h1>
	<h2 id="sub-par-2-1">PCI 4.1 and Prompting for Input</h2>
	The Luxe terminals are PCI 4.1 certified, and this places some restrictions on the application display
	 of prompts (that is, messages asking for the input of data).  As stated from the <b>PCI PIN Transaction
	 Security (PTS) Point of Interaction (POI) Modular Security Requirements:</b>
	
	<p style='margin-left: 80px'>
		All prompts for non-PIN data entry are under the control of the cryptographic unit
		of the device. If the prompts are stored inside the cryptographic unit, they cannot
		feasibly be altered without causing the erasure of the unit's cryptographic keys.
		If the prompts are stored outside the cryptographic unit, cryptographic mechanisms
		must exist to ensure the authenticity and the proper use of the prompts and that
		modification of the prompts or improper use of the prompts is prevented.
	</p>
	For additional information on the Luxe solution for the display of prompts, please refer to
	 the <a href='/html/sdk/documentation/Luxe_HTTP_API_Specification.pdf''>Luxe HTTP API Specification</a>, Appendix C. Prompts and Secure Input Functions.
	
	
	<h1 id="par-3"><a href='/html/sdk/section_4/chapter_4.html'>Chapter 4 - HTML / JavaScript Applications</a></h1>
	The WWW originated as a method of sharing static files stored on a remote web server.  With the advent of web server side
	 software, developer's quickly evolved methods of generating the pages on the fly on the server side.
	  The next advancement was the addition of web browser software tools (JavaScript) to allow for the modification
	 of pages on the fly on the web browser client side.
	<p/>
	HTML5 has built upon this with the inclusion of HTML for basic page presentation, CSS for page presentation,
	 and JavaScript for page logic and behaviour.
	<p/>
	For security reasons, traditional web pages did not have access to the internal resources of the machine on
	 which the browser was running.  All information needed to be stored and retrieved from the remote web server.
	  However, the W3C recognised that for modern tablets and smartphone type HTML5 applications, there is a need
	 for HTML5 apps to access some parts of the device, such as access to the GPS system for location information,
	 the camera for virtual reality apps, etc, and they are actively working on adding other support (local
	 database storage) for other devices through the Device API's Working Group (<a href='https://www.w3.org/2009/dap/'>https://www.w3.org/2009/dap/</a>)
	<p>
	In developing HTML5/JavaScript applications for the Luxe terminal, Microsoft supplies a set JavaScript  library functions and Application Programming Interface (API) specifications that allows the JavaScript application developer to rapidly write applications on the Luxe series of devices.
	<p>
	
	<h1 id="par-4"><a href='/html/sdk/section_4/chapter_5.html'>Chapter 5 - C/C++ Applications</a></h1>
	In developing C/C++ applications for the Luxe terminals, Microsoft supplies an Ubuntu based
	  GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) , set of C/C++ library functions, and Application Programming Interface
	 (API) documentation that allows the C/C++ application developer to rapidly write new applications or
	 port existing C/C++ applications on to the Luxe family of terminals.
